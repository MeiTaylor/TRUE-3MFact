# Pioneering Explainable Video Fact-Checking with a New Dataset and Multi-role Multimodal Model Approach

Official repository for "[Pioneering Explainable Video Fact-Checking with a New Dataset and Multi-role Multimodal Model Approach](https://openreview.net/forum?id=fln4pLoJxK)" (Published in AAAI AISI 2025).



## Overview

We present TRUE (Truthfulness and Rationale with Underlying Evidence), a comprehensive video fact-checking dataset that includes detailed annotations for veracity labels, rationales, and supporting evidence. Along with the dataset, we also introduce 3MFact, a multi-role collaboration framework for video fact-checking.



## Getting Started

### TRUE Dataset
- Download the TRUE dataset from [Baidu Netdisk]( https://pan.baidu.com/s/1yNA4dg5H1sxm5-XqUr-SQw?pwd=r8ws) | [OneDrive](https://whueducn-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/kaipengniu_whu_edu_cn/EcMBGGGA7VVHsTwLui4gJMYBZDH-p3A8GJiXHamIiVTkoA?e=GPhcfv)
- For detailed documentation of the dataset structure, components, and statistics, please refer to [`TRUE_Dataset/TRUE_Dataset.md`](./TRUE_Dataset/TRUE_Dataset.md)

### 3MFact Code
- For setup, training, and evaluation instructions, please refer to [`3MFact_Code/Code_USAGE.md`](./3MFact_Code/Code_USAGE.md)
- The implementation code and usage instructions are in `3MFact_Code/`
